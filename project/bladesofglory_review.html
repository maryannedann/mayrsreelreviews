        <div class="review_title">Blades of Glory: How Could You Not Find It Funny</div>

        <div class="review_text">
            Blades of Glory is the kind of movie that you just cant help but laugh at. I am a person that appriciates comedy, but can sometimes find some comedy movies a bit dim-witted. Dont get me wrong, Blades of Glory is, but its just so dumb its insanely funny. This gem of a comedy stars Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as two rival figure skaters who team up to compete as the first-ever male pair in the sport's history. How could you not find this funny?

            Ferrell plays Chazz Michael Michaels, the bad boy of figure skating with a penchant for sequins and sass. Meanwhile, Heder channels his inner awkwardness as Jimmy MacElroy, a sweet, but sheltered skater with a heart of gold. Together, they're a match made in comedic heaven.

            From the outrageous costumes to the over-the-top skating routines, "Blades of Glory" is a riot from start to finish. There are moments that will have you doubling over with laughter and others that will leave you wondering how they pulled off those stunts without breaking every bone in their bodies.

            But it's not just the slapstick humor that makes this movie a winner. The supporting cast, including scene-stealers like Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, brings their A-game, delivering one-liners and sight gags that hit the mark every time.

            Sure, "Blades of Glory" may not be highbrow entertainment, but who needs highbrow when you've got Ferrell and Heder doing double axels in spandex? So if you're in the mood for a laugh-out-loud comedy that's as sharp as its titular blades, grab some popcorn, settle in, and get ready to bust a gut.
